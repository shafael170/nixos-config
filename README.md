> **DO NOT USE THIS REPO/THESE CONFIGS AS IS FOR YOUR OWN PERSONAL USE.** The configs here are written exactly for my use case and accordingly for my hardware. If you *still* want to use these configs, please edit and adjust ***every .nix file*** to make them suitable for your use case. I'm still new to NixOS, and I use this repository to lazily clone configurations between my devices and VMs for testing purposes.
